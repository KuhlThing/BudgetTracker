### BudgetTracker

 AS A budget-conscious user,  
 I NEED an app that can function online and off  
 SO THAT I can keep track of my finances even when out of service area.
 
 #### PURPOSE
 
The purpose of this app is to track the users expenses and gains online or offline without interruption. The user types in the name of the transaction, then the amount, then selects whether it is an expense (subtract funds) or a gain (add funds). The app then displays a chart tracking their finances.

#### Installation

The app can be installed in a terminal by typing 'npm install', then 'npm start', then navigating to localhost:3000. A deployed version can be found [here](https://secure-oasis-13528.herokuapp.com)
